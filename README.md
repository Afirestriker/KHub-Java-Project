## :scroll: Lessons Learned

No matter what type of project you are building or working on, the experience and the knowledge you gain from it cannot be measure.
Some of the thing that I learned while building this project is that creating a project is not a one day task and you need to be consistent.
Keep building, converting and enjoying the process as you move forward.
Aslo note that mistakes are their to happen, but you should not shy from it. Analysed your mistakes, and learned from it.

Some of main lession I learned:
- Start with a plan, Brainstorm and not just directly jump on it.
- Be a little proactive.
- If its a large projects, divide it into modules.
- Make prototype / Wireframe of your idea/module. This will prevent any future problem and save time.
- Document as you build and not postponed it to the end.

# "Build, make mistake, learned from it and build again."
